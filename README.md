## Running this Bot in Another Environment
Currently, it is not simple to run this bot elsewhere. This is because I use my own private Terraform modules to power the infrastructure behind it in AWS. Therefore, if you do decide to attempt to do so, you will be on your own when it comes to hosting it. However, the Dockerfile should build just about anywhere, so the knowledge you will need to run it largely pertains to running containerized applications in Docker. You will also need the following external accounts or services:

### Required Accounts
* A DeepL account, as the bot uses an Auth Key for its text translation functionality.
* A Discord Bot account, as you will need a Token in order for the bot to log into Discord.

### Required Environment Variables
* `DISCORD_TOKEN` -- The token used by the bot to interact with Discord
* `DEEPL_AUTH_KEY` -- The token used to interact with the DeepL service
